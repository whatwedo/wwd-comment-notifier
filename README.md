Developed with â™¥ by whatwedo(https://whatwedo.ch) in Bern

> Note: This plugin was initially written in 2019 and used on a production site for 6 years.
> The client doesn't need the functionality anymore, but we thought it could still be useful or an inspiration for some people.
>
> We don't maintain this code for future changes, but it was working up the following system requirements as of May 2025:
> - WordPress 6.8
> - PHP 8.4

## Config
The plugin is shipped without any option page in WordPress. To configure the plugin use the JSON file in the config folder. This is a stateful and developer friendly way to customize the plugin.

Copy the config file within the `config` directory and adjust the content for your preferences.
Add the custom config to your theme and use the following hook to register it:

```
add_filter('wwdcn_config_path', function () {
    return get_template_directory() . '/config/custom-notifier-config.json';
});
```
